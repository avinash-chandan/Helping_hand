	<h3>Generally, waste could be liquid or solid waste. Both of them could be hazardous. Liquid and solid waste types 
	can also be grouped into organic, re-usable and recyclable waste. Hazardous or harmful waste are those that potentially threaten public health or 
	the environment. Such waste could be inflammable (can easily catch fire), reactive (can easily explode), corrosive (can easily eat through metal) or 
	toxic (poisonous to human and animals). In many countries, it is required by law to involve the appropriate authority to supervise the disposal of such 
	hazardous waste. Examples include fire extinguishers, old propane tanks, pesticides, mercury-containing equipment (e.g, thermostats) and lamps 
	(e.g. fluorescent bulbs) and batteries.</h3><br><br>

	<h3>Organic waste comes from plants or animals sources. Commonly, they include food waste, fruit and vegetable peels, flower trimmings and 
	even dog poop can be classified as organic waste. They are biodegradable (this means they are easily broken down by other organisms over time and 
	turned into manure). Many people turn their organic waste into compost and use them in their gardens.</h3><br><br>

	<h2>Medical sources of waste:</h2><br>
	<h3>Medical waste, normally refers to waste produced from health care facilities, such as hospitals, clinics, surgical theaters, veterinary 
	hospitals and labs. They tend to be classified as hazard waste rather than general waste.
   Items in this group include surgical items, pharmaceuticals, blood, body parts, wound dressing materials, needles and syringes</h3><br><br>

	<h3>When cars are all old and not working again, where do they end up? Many people just leave them to rust in the fields, but there is a better way to 
	deal with them. In many cities, these vehicles are sent to the plant, where all the removable parts are taken out for recycling. The rest is 
	flattened up and shredded into peices for recycling. The last bits that cannot be used again is sent to a landfill.</h3>
